# GetNextLine
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, reading from a file descriptor.

From this project, we gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and life cycle of a buffer and the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
